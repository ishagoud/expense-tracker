#  Expense Tracker Web Application

##  Project Overview

This is a web-based **Expense Tracker** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It helps users **track income and expenses**, categorize each transaction, and view a real-time summary including **total income, total expense, and net balance**.

All data is stored using **localStorage**, so users can revisit the app and still see their transaction history. The design is clean, mobile-responsive, and built entirely from scratch — no frameworks or templates used.

##  Objective
